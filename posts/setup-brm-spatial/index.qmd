    Note: These are two different things, so please ensure you have installed both of them. Take a look also at <https://bruneir.github.io/posts/how-to-install-r-and-rstudio/>

2.  Install the following R packages by running the following code in the RStudio console:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| code-fold: false
    install.packages(c(
      "tidyverse", 
      "sf", 
      "kernlab", 
      "ggrepel", 
      "osrm", 
      "remotes",
      "CARBayes",
      "mapview",
      "scales",
      "ggsci"
    ))
    ```

3.  Install the `{bruneimap}` package by running the following code in the RStudio console.

    remotes::install_github("propertypricebn/bruneimap")
    ```

<u>Addendum</u>

Depending on the OS you are using, you may need to install additional developer tools.

-   For Windows users, you may need to install Rtools from <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

-   For Mac users, you may need to install Xcode from the App Store (or see here <https://mac.r-project.org/tools/>).

-   Linux users should be fine, as the necessary compiler tools are usually installed by default.
