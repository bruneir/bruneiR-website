Our focus will be on leveraging R for the importation, analysis, and visualization of spatial data (e.g.¬†shapefile data). By integrating these with various study data, such as house price data modelling, disease outbreak mapping, and physicochemical soil data analysis, we unlock new insights and opportunities for innovative research.\nThis introductory session will serve as your gateway to the essential R packages and textbook references needed for effective spatial data analysis. We‚Äôll cover a few basic spatial statistical methods, with a special emphasis on Bruneian spatial data, to provide local context and relevance.\n\n\n2 Event Format\nThe session will be an interactive live-coding lecture, where you will get to follow along and apply what you learn in real-time. We encourage all participants to bring their laptops and ensure internet connectivity; Wi-Fi will be available for UBD affiliates, while others may need to arrange for hotspot access.\n\n\n3 Who Should Attend?\n\nIndividuals with a keen interest in spatial data and GIS\nR users of all levels seeking to expand their skills, especially in spatial data analysis\nResearchers and students in various fields looking to incorporate spatial analysis into their work\n\n\n\n4 Prerequisities\nA basic understanding of R will be beneficial but is not mandatory. Our community is known for its supportive and friendly members, ready to assist anyone who may encounter challenges during the coding exercises.\n\n\n5 Why Should You Attend?\n\nGain foundational knowledge in handling and analyzing spatial data with R\nDiscover the potential of integrating spatial data with other types of study data\nConnect with fellow R enthusiasts and experts in an interactive and supportive environment\nEnhance your research or professional projects with spatial data insights\n\n\nAll user levels are welcome, and we look forward to seeing you there! üéâ"
